# Exploring Hacker News Posts
In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.

We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are a couple examples:

Ask HN: How to improve my personal website? Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts? Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?

Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. Below are a couple of examples:

Show HN: Wio Link ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform' Show HN: Something pointless I made Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
